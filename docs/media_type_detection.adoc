= Media Type Detection

== Library
The Object Store module uses https://tika.apache.org/[Apache Tika] to try to automagically detect the media type when possible.

== Expected behavior
The Object Store module will behave differently depending on the information included in the multipart upload. As a general rule, the module will use the media type and the file extension (extracted from the filename) that is provided with the file upload (if available).

=== Content-Type provided
If the Content-Type of the file is specified in the multipart upload, the Object Store will still detect the media-type but will only store it in the metadata field and return it to the user as information.

=== No Content-Type provided
If the Content-Type of the file is NOT specified in the multipart upload, the Object Store will detect the media type. If a filename is provided the file extension will be preserved otherwise the default extension of the
detected media type will be used.
